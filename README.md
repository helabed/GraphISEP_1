# GraphISEP_1
Graphically Interactive Structural Engineering Program - One (GraphISEP 1)

This program was part of my Master's of Engineering thesis at the University of Wisconsin - Madison (1991)

[The Application of the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm In Developing Structural Engineering Computer programs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K8eX76825fJd8Y4yKsxIHGSn5zcTPYPX/view)


GraphISEP One was developed in 1990 with `Think C with Objects` and the `Think Class Library`.

`Think C with Objects` was the first incarnation of `Objective-C` and eventually became Symantec C++ with the Symantec Class Library.

This was my first massive body of work before graduating and becoming an engineer then a programmer.

This was before any version control system existed - i.e no CVS, no SVN, and definitely no Git or Github.

We kept track of changes mentally and backed up our application folder/directory very frequently to external hard disks. (or floppy disks)

Chapter 3 and 4 of my Master's Thesis (above) have a gazzillion screenshots of how GraphISEP One worked. And the class names in the thesis match those in the code of this project.

Enjoy !
